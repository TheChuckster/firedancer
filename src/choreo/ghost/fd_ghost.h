/* fd_ghost ("greedy heaviest-observed subtree") is an implementation of the fork choice protocol.
   It is latest message-driven (LMD) ie. only a validator's last vote counts toward the tree
   weights.

   greedy - pick the locally optimum subtree / fork right now, which may not be optimal later.
   heaviest - pick the fork with the most vote stake.
   observed - this is the validator's local view, and other validator's may have different trees.
   subtree - all descendant votes in a subtree are counted towards the ancestor.

   fd_ghost_node_t represents the n-ary tree of forks. Each node holds a pointer to the left-most
   child, and a pointer to siblings. The node also tracks the sum of stakes (stake) for that
   specific node as well as sum of stakes of the subtree rooted at that node (weight).

   fd_ghost_msg_t represents the latest message from a validator. Each message is keyed by the slot
   hash, which is the slot hash of the validator's vote, and also contains the validator's pubkey
   and stake.
